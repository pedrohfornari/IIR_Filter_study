# IIR_Filter_study

Study of IIR filters and how to optimize them to implement on a microprocessor

Developped by Pedro Fornari and Lucas Pereira Luiz

Project in MATLAB to study the implementation and optimization of IIR filters.
We applied the quantization to se how finite memory can diminish the filter quality.
Also developped an algorithm to optimize the filter quantized until it respect the requirements limits
